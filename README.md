CoMind is a community-augmented LLM agent for automated machine learning engineering that leverages collective knowledge from Kaggle-style competitions. CoMind achieves state-of-the-art performance on MLE-Live and outperforms 79.2% of human competitors on average across four ongoing Kaggle competitions.

Inspired by the workflow of human practitioners, CoMind operates in a loop that mirrors how experts read community posts, form new ideas, experiment, and share results. CoMind maintains two central repositories: an idea pool containing abstracted insights derived from community content and prior iterations, and a report pool with finalized solution reports, including code, evaluations, and analyses.

## ‚ú® Quick Start

### üé° Installation

First, clone the repository and navigate to the project directory:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/comind-ml/CoMind.git
cd CoMind
```

Then, build the dependencies and install `comind-community` and `comind-agent` using pip. The `-e` flag installs the project in editable mode.
```bash
pip install -e .
```

To isolate the execution environment, `comind-agent` runs and analyzes the LLM-generated Python code within a üê≥ Docker container. If you plan to use GPUs, you'll need to install the [NVIDIA Container Toolkit](https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/container-toolkit/latest/install-guide.html).

Build the Docker container with the following commands:
```bash
cd docker
docker build -t comind-agent .
```

### ü•™ Prepare Datasets

Before running CoMind, you need to download the competition datasets and public resources from Kaggle. The `./competition/download.py` script provides a command-line interface for this purpose. Please ensure you have placed your Kaggle API credentials (`kaggle.json`) in the `~/.kaggle/` directory.

For example, to download all resources for a competition and store them in the `./competitions` directory, run:
```bash
python ./competition/download.py -c <competition-id> --download-dir ./competitions -d -k -t
```

> **Parameters**: 
> - `-c`, `--competition`: The competition ID. You can find this in the URL of the competition's homepage: `https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/<competition-id>`.
> - `-dir`, `--download-dir`: The directory to store the downloaded data. Defaults to `./competitions`.
> - `-e`, `--exclude-after-deadline`: Whether to exclude public discussions/kernels created after the competition's deadline. Defaults to `True`.
> - `-d`, `--dataset`: Flag to download the dataset.
> - `-k`, `--kernels`: Flag to fetch public kernels.
> - `-t`, `--discussions`: Flag to fetch public discussions.
> - `-f`, `--force`: Flag to re-download and overwrite existing data.

After preparation, the target directory will be structured as follows:
```txt
./competitions/<competition-id>
    |- input
        |- train.csv
        |- test.csv
        |- ...
    |- kernels
        |- info.json
        |- 283721122.txt 
        |- ...
    |- discussions
        |- info.json
        |- 2311122.txt
        |- ...
    |- description.md
```

### üïπÔ∏è Running Agents

First, launch the community server. This server manages the exchange of ideas and results.
```bash
comind-community llm.api_key=<your-api-key> community.competition_dir=./competitions/<competition-id>
```

Please wait for the community server to initialize before launching the agents.

Multiple agents can run in parallel to generate solutions and contribute to the community. To launch a single agent, run:
```bash
comind-agent llm.api_key=<your-api-key> input_dir=./competitions/<competition-id>/input
```

For more configuration options, see the [Community Configs](./configs/community/default.yaml) and [Agent Configs](./configs/agent/default.yaml).
